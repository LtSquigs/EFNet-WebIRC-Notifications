EFNet WebChat Desktop Notifications Chrome Plugin
==================================

This Chrome Plugin adds Desktop Notifications to the EFNet Webchat application. Desktop Notifications appear for every message that is sent to the chat rooms the user is logged into (if the window is not active)

The settings for the plugin can be used to change how long plugins are displayed, and the plugin can be disabled per web chat page.
